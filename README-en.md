# Solo

[简体中文](README.md) | **English**

A lightweight tool for protecting/hiding server ports

## Features
Solo is suitable for developers who meet the following conditions:
1. Have their own server supported by [Solo](#supported-cloud-providers)
2. Have important ports on the server, such as SSH, remote desktop, BT panel, etc.
3. Want these ports to be accessible only by themselves, not exposed publicly and not scanned

With just a few simple steps, you can make these ports accessible only to you while preventing access by others:

1. Install Solo on your personal device
2. Configure according to the [documentation](https://solo.lance.fun/)
3. Run Solo (can be set to start on boot or run periodically)
